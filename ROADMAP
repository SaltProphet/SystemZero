🔮 Phase 6: Observability + Deployment Hardening [PLANNING]

Goal: Secure, observable deployment with operator metrics and configuration management.

- Add authentication/authorization on API (tokens, roles)
- Integrate structured request logging and metrics (latency, error rates)
- Add health/readiness probes and graceful shutdown hooks
- Provide Docker image + compose profile with volume mounts for logs/templates
- Expand dashboard data to include API health and ingestion counters

🛠 Tools: YAML, pathlib, csv, json

This roadmap is modular. Each phase can be tracked as a GitHub Project or Issue board. All modules are deterministic and testable in isolation.

🧭 System//Zero Build Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the complete build path from scaffold to operational deployment of the System//Zero environment parser. Each phase is modular, deterministic, and designed for GitHub-based development using Copilot, Codex, and CLI tools.

✅ Phase 0: Baseline Confirmation ✓ COMPLETE

[x] Scaffold generated with full folder/file structure (74 files)

[x] CLI entrypoint wired (run.py → interface.cli.main)

[x] YAML baseline templates seeded (discord_chat, doordash_offer, system_default)

[x] Drift engine + logger stubbed (DriftEvent, ImmutableLog, HashChain)

✅ Phase 1: Core Pipeline Implementation ✓ COMPLETE

Goal: Build the ingestion → normalization → matching → logging pipeline

[x] Implement AccessibilityListener and TreeCapture

[x] Normalize UI trees via TreeNormalizer, NodeClassifier, NoiseFilters

[x] Generate layout signatures with SignatureGenerator

[x] Load and validate templates with TemplateLoader and TemplateValidator

[x] Compare trees to baselines using BaselineMatcher, DiffEngine, TransitionChecker

[x] Generate DriftEvent objects

[x] Write to ImmutableLog with EventWriter and HashChain

🛠 Tools: GitHub Copilot, Codex, pytest

🧪 Phase 1.5: Pre-Phase 2 Foundation ✓ COMPLETE

Goal: Create test infrastructure and fixtures for Phase 2 development

[x] Create test fixtures library (mock_trees.py, drift_scenarios.py, templates.py)

[x] Build integration test helpers (tests/helpers.py)

[x] Stub CLI commands for simulate, drift, replay

[x] Complete baseline template gallery with real signatures

[x] Document expected behaviors and test strategy

🛠 Tools: pytest, YAML, Python fixtures

🔁 Phase 2: Mock Pipeline + Test Harness

Goal: Simulate events and validate pipeline behavior

[ ] Create mock UI trees and simulate accessibility events

[ ] Build CLI test harness: sz simulate, sz drift, sz replay

[ ] Validate log output and hash chaining

🛠 Tools: pytest, GitHub Actions, Codex

🧠 Phase 3: Operator Intelligence Layer

Goal: Surface insights and enable situational awareness

[ ] Implement CLI/UI dashboard for live screen state and drift alerts

[ ] Build forensic replay viewer with timeline navigation

[ ] Add cross-app consistency monitor

🛠 Tools: Rich, Textual, GitHub Projects

🧱 Phase 4: Extension + Template Engine

Goal: Capture new screens and build reusable templates

[ ] Implement Recorder and UITreeExport

[ ] Build TemplateBuilder to convert captures into YAML

[ ] Add Validators and Exporters

[ ] Enable versioned template store with rollback

🛠 Tools: YAML, Codex, GitHub versioning

⚙️ Phase 5: Deployment + Operator Tooling

Goal: Make System//Zero usable in the field

[ ] Expand CLI: sz capture, sz baseline, sz export

[ ] Build REST API with FastAPI or Flask

[ ] Run as background service via systemd or pm2

🛠 Tools: FastAPI, GitHub CLI, systemd

🔐 Phase 6: Security + Integrity

Goal: Ensure tamper-evidence and runtime trust

[ ] Implement hash-chain verification for logs

[ ] Sign and validate baseline templates

[ ] Detect environment tampering (e.g. disabled accessibility)

🛠 Tools: Python cryptography, GPG, GitHub Secrets

🚀 Phase 7: Finalization + CI/CD

Goal: Harden, document, and ship

[ ] Full test coverage with pytest

[ ] CI/CD via GitHub Actions

[ ] Operator documentation in docs/

[ ] Public repo prep: README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING

[ ] Optional: Dockerfile + deployment script

This roadmap is modular. Each phase can be tracked as a GitHub Project or Issue board. All modules are deterministic and testable in isolation.

🧭 System//Zero Build Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the complete build path from scaffold to operational deployment of the System//Zero environment parser. Each phase is modular, deterministic, and designed for GitHub-based development using Copilot, Codex, and CLI tools.

✅ Phase 0: Baseline Confirmation ✓ COMPLETE

[x] Scaffold generated with full folder/file structure (74 files)

[x] CLI entrypoint wired (run.py → interface.cli.main)

[x] YAML baseline templates seeded (discord_chat, doordash_offer, system_default)

[x] Drift engine + logger stubbed (DriftEvent, ImmutableLog, HashChain)

✅ Phase 1: Core Pipeline Implementation ✓ COMPLETE

Goal: Build the ingestion → normalization → matching → logging pipeline

[x] Implement AccessibilityListener and TreeCapture

[x] Normalize UI trees via TreeNormalizer, NodeClassifier, NoiseFilters

[x] Generate layout signatures with SignatureGenerator

[x] Load and validate templates with TemplateLoader and TemplateValidator

[x] Compare trees to baselines using BaselineMatcher, DiffEngine, TransitionChecker

[x] Generate DriftEvent objects

[x] Write to ImmutableLog with EventWriter and HashChain

🛠 Tools: GitHub Copilot, Codex, pytest

🧪 Phase 1.5: Pre-Phase 2 Foundation ✓ COMPLETE

Goal: Create test infrastructure and fixtures for Phase 2 development

[x] Create test fixtures library (mock_trees.py, drift_scenarios.py, templates.py)

[x] Build integration test helpers (tests/helpers.py)

[x] Stub CLI commands for simulate, drift, replay

[x] Complete baseline template gallery with real signatures

[x] Document expected behaviors and test strategy

🛠 Tools: pytest, YAML, Python fixtures

🔁 Phase 2: Mock Pipeline + Test Harness

Goal: Simulate events and validate pipeline behavior

[ ] Create mock UI trees and simulate accessibility events

[ ] Build CLI test harness: sz simulate, sz drift, sz replay

[ ] Validate log output and hash chaining

🛠 Tools: pytest, GitHub Actions, Codex

🧠 Phase 3: Operator Intelligence Layer

Goal: Surface insights and enable situational awareness

[ ] Implement CLI/UI dashboard for live screen state and drift alerts

[ ] Build forensic replay viewer with timeline navigation

[ ] Add cross-app consistency monitor

🛠 Tools: Rich, Textual, GitHub Projects

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
🧱 Phase 4: Extension + Template Engine

Goal: Capture new screens and build reusable templates

[ ] Implement Recorder and UITreeExport
=======
**Status**: COMPLETE – Operator UIs shipped; 98/98 tests passing; defaults to logs/systemzero.log (widgets also accept logs/drift.log)

**Next actions**
- Fold any remaining Priority 2 enhancements into Phase 4 backlog
- Socialize operator workflows and capture user feedback

🧱 Phase 4: Extension + Template Engine ✓ COMPLETE

Goal: Capture new screens and build reusable templates

**Status**: COMPLETE – 103/103 tests passing, capture-to-template pipeline shipped

[x] Address Priority 2 enhancements (Matcher.calculate_score, DiffEngine structure, NodeClassifier roles, NoiseFilters filters)
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

[x] Implement Recorder and UITreeExport

[x] Build TemplateBuilder to convert captures into YAML

[x] Add Validators and Exporters

[x] Enable CLI commands: capture, baseline, export

**Deliverables**: Recorder + UITreeExport, TemplateBuilder, validators, exporters, new CLI commands, full test suite

**Next Actions**:
- Phase 5 can now build REST API, versioned template store, bulk operations on captured data
- See PHASE4_COMPLETION.md for detailed workflow and usage examples

🚀 Phase 5: REST API + Remote Control ✓ COMPLETE

Goal: Expose pipeline operations over HTTP and provide a CLI server for operators.

**Status**: COMPLETE – 111/111 tests passing, FastAPI service online.

[x] FastAPI server with endpoints for status, captures, templates, logs, dashboard
[x] CLI `server` command (`run.py server --host --port --reload`)
[x] Log export API (json/csv/html) and template listing/building
[x] API test suite (`tests/test_api.py`) covering all routes
[x] Deprecation cleanup (Query pattern, timezone-aware timestamps)

**Next Actions**:
- Harden auth/config for API (API keys, rate limits)
- Package server launch in container/task runners
- Expose template versioning endpoints

🔮 Phase 6: Observability + Deployment Hardening [PLANNING]

Goal: Secure, observable deployment with operator metrics and configuration management.

- Add authentication/authorization on API (tokens, roles)
- Integrate structured request logging and metrics (latency, error rates)
- Add health/readiness probes and graceful shutdown hooks
- Provide Docker image + compose profile with volume mounts for logs/templates
- Expand dashboard data to include API health and ingestion counters

🛠 Tools: YAML, pathlib, csv, json

⚙️ Phase 5: Deployment + Operator Tooling

Goal: Make System//Zero usable in the field

[ ] Build REST API with FastAPI

[ ] Build REST API with FastAPI or Flask

[ ] Run as background service via systemd or pm2

🛠 Tools: FastAPI, GitHub CLI, systemd

🔐 Phase 6: Security + Integrity

Goal: Ensure tamper-evidence and runtime trust

[ ] Implement hash-chain verification for logs

[ ] Sign and validate baseline templates

[ ] Detect environment tampering (e.g. disabled accessibility)

🛠 Tools: Python cryptography, GPG, GitHub Secrets

🚀 Phase 7: Finalization + CI/CD

Goal: Harden, document, and ship

[ ] Full test coverage with pytest

[ ] CI/CD via GitHub Actions

[ ] Operator documentation in docs/

[ ] Public repo prep: README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING

[ ] Optional: Dockerfile + deployment script

This roadmap is modular. Each phase can be tracked as a GitHub Project or Issue board. All modules are deterministic and testable in isolation.
